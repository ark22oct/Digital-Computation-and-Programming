# Digital Computation and Programming
Theory and practice of computer programming, using the C programming language. In-depth emphasis is on program form/organization, pseudo-code, data types, conditional expressions, repetition, standard C libraries, casting,functions, arrays, pointers, sorting, recursion, matrix operations, dynamic storage, structures, linked lists, I/O.

Term project for Digital Computation and Programming using C and Geany. Feel free to reference, but avoid copying. Aimed to extract various types of information from an initial data set of the “Daily Lake Average Surface Water Temperature From Great Lakes Surface Environmental Analysis maps” for 365 days and the year 2019. This included the surface water temperature in °C of the 6 great lakes in Canada which are: Lake Superior, Lake Huron, Lake Michigan, Lake Erie, Lake Ontario and, Lake Superior. The type of information extracted from the data set includes but is not limited to: yearly average temperature for the lakes, warmest and coldest lake, yearly summer average, yearly winter average, days the lakes are safe to swim in and days the lakes are dangerous to swim in. This can all be calculated by a C program through the use of 2D Arrays which will display the different averages. Accomplished using C and Geany. Feel free to reference, but avoid copying.
